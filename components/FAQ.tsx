    question: 'What is a venture‑client accelerator?',
    answer:
      'A venture‑client accelerator enables corporates to become early customers of startups. Rather than investing equity, corporates engage startups as clients, providing early revenue and real‑world validation while solving strategic challenges.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Who can apply to QuantXlr8?',
    answer:
      'We welcome applications from growth‑stage startups with differentiated technology, corporates seeking to address innovation challenges, and investors interested in early exposure to emerging solutions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you take equity or board seats?',
    answer:
      'No. As a venture‑client accelerator we purchase solutions from startups for pilot projects. There is no equity investment, allowing startups to maintain full ownership.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long is the program?',
    answer:
      'Pilot durations vary based on the challenge but typically last between 3–6 months. Following a successful pilot, scaling engagements are negotiated between the corporate and startup.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there a fee to participate?',
    answer:
      'There is no fee for startups. Corporates fund the pilot projects, creating real revenue opportunities for participating startups.',
