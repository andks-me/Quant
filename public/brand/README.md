# QuantXlr8 Brand Guidelines

These guidelines outline the core elements of the QuantXlr8 (QX8) visual identity. Use them to maintain consistency across digital and print materials.

## Logo & Wordmark

- **Wordmark (qx8-logo.svg)** – The full wordmark spells out “QuantXlr8” with a stylised **X** forming a forward‑pointing arrow to evoke acceleration. The superscript 8 sits slightly above the baseline, mirroring the product name. Use this version on light backgrounds.
- **Wordmark (Dark) (qx8-logo-dark.svg)** – Inverts the colours for use on dark backgrounds. Text appears in light gray with a teal arrow accent.
- **Monogram Mark (qx8‑mark.svg)** – A rounded square containing the letters **QX8** with a diagonal teal accent. Suitable for avatars, favicons or places where space is limited.
- **Monogram Mark (Dark) (qx8‑mark‑dark.svg)** – Electric blue square with dark lettering and teal accent for use against dark backgrounds.

Allow generous clear space around the mark equal to half its height. Do not distort, recolour or rotate the logo.

## Colour Palette

| Name          | Hex      | Usage                                          |
|--------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Deep Navy     | `#0B1020` | Primary background colour and dominant tone.    |
| Electric Blue | `#2D6BFF` | Headlines, links and primary call‑to‑action.   |
| Teal Accent   | `#00C2B8` | Secondary accent for highlights and icons.     |
| Neutral Gray  | `#E9EDF2` | Light text and backgrounds for contrast.       |
| Onyx          | `#0A0A0A` | Footer background and subtle dark elements.    |

## Typography

- **Headlines** – Use **Inter** (variable or 700 weight) for headings. It offers a modern, geometric feel that conveys innovation and clarity. Falls back to system sans‑serif fonts.
- **Body copy** – Use **Source Sans 3** for paragraphs and long‑form text. Its humanist forms provide warmth and readability.

Both fonts are loaded via Google Fonts in the Next.js layout and exposed as CSS variables (`--font-inter` and `--font-source`).

## Motif

The brand combines concepts of acceleration and quantum mechanics. Visual motifs include lines converging into arrows, discretised ticks and network nodes. These can appear as backgrounds or decorative elements but should not distract from the content.

## Favicons & App Icons

PNG icons are exported at multiple sizes from the monogram mark and referenced in `site.webmanifest`. Use them for browser tabs, shortcuts and mobile home‑screen icons.

## Usage Notes

- Maintain sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds to meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards.
- Use the electric blue for primary actions and interactive elements; reserve teal for secondary highlights.
- Ensure the superscript 8 in the wordmark is clearly legible at all sizes.
